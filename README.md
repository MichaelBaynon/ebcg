The major dependency that I used was react-router/react-router-dom. I used this so that on their site users would have a smooth seamless transitition between web pages.

When creating a standard React app I either come up with the UX conceptually or analyze the UX mockup. From there I lay out the format of the site in my head. With this site I did not have a UX mockup and came up with the design on my own. So that was my first objective. 

Looking at the client's old site and thinking of ways to modernize their information in a clean presentable way. After I lay out the skeleton of the site in my mind I create the folders. For this project I decided to have two main folders; the components(which are the reusable components) and the screens which represent each individual page. 

For most projects my first priority in development is making the navigation. This way as the developer the site is easier to navigate and I can work out any bugs as I move along. After I get the navigation setup and hooked up with Routes and all. I then simply make each page. 
All the while I am looking back at the clients original site to make sure I have a good understanding of what information they need displayed. After I layout each page with just a simple one line of text saying what each page is. I usually just work cronilogically along the navigation bar. 

Luckily this site is relavitively easy to create and maintain. The reason I chose this site over all the others is I beleive this is one of my best examples of my work. Both in terms of actual code and creativity with coming up with the site design. 

While I am prideful of this site it would be an injustice to claim this is all my knowledge when this is far from it. 

I also have knowledge in the backend process using NodeJS as shown here. https://github.com/bw-howto/backend In case you didnt already know I created this entire Node backend myself sporting a couple of great features including a login, signup, and the creation of content on the site. While I would normally link you the site I only worked on the backend and the frontend portion of this project is nothing great and may give you the wrong impression of my work. 

In terms of higher level JavaScript concepts I would say that the project "College Value" https://github.com/College-Value/FrontEnd-college-value is a good testament of the kind of work I can produce. For this project I worked with a two Data Science colleagues, a backend Developer and a lower level junior developer aswell of course the Team Lead. During the project I created the login and signup functionality. 

There are a couple great highlights of this project and one of the major ones was more of a soft skill in that I worked with a Java backend and that in itself was a challenge. The reason I highlight this as a soft skill accomplishment is because I had never worked on a Java backend and yet I was still able to collaborate and succesfully adapt my knowledge to work alongside the backend which I understood so little of at the time. 

The other major highlight was my work with the lower level Junior Developer. The reason I highlight this is because I was able to help and guide this developer and with my help she was able to complete her portion of the site. Working directly with someone teaching and guiding them to success was a rewarding and eductational experience. 

If there is any other things you would like to know or hear from me feel free to reach out and let me know. If there is anything you would like to see that is not present in this ReadME I am more then willing to present that work. This is just a small sample of work.
My portfolio found here https://michaelbaynon.com/ can be a good place to find some of other work. 

Thank you for reading.
